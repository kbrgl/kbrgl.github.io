I created this website to serve as a showcase for me, Kabir Goel. Apart from the blog (where I'll probably be posting tech stuff), I'm going to create a 'projects' and 'about me' page.  
\\
The site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). In designing the UI, I took heavy inspiration from [the blog of James Long](http:/jlongster.com) and [The Usability Post](http://usabilitypost.com).

Be sure to check back here regularly, and I'll do my best to keep you engaged.

My website is mostly made up of vanilla HTML and CSS. Apart from these two, I'm also using Skeleton (getskeleton.com) for the grid system, jQuery (jquery.com) for black magic and Jekyll (jekyllrb.com) for blogging kewlness. There's nothing else.
Also, for the coders wondering why my indentation is messed up - Jekyll did that.
You can check out my source code at http://github.com/kbrgl/kbrgl.github.io :D

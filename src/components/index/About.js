    <p>
      I&#39;ve always enjoyed building (and breaking!) stuff, and I&#39;ve loved
      writing code ever since I found out there&#39;s a way to experience the
      thrill of creating beautiful things without having to move for extended
      periods of time. I&#39;m a huge US politics junkie: I enjoy learning about
      political processes &amp; institutions and their impact on American
      citizens.

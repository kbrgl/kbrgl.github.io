    <p>
      I&#39;m a student in 11th grade at Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, and a
      member of the computer club, the quizzing club and the debating society.
      I&#39;ve got physics, math, economics, and computer science as my primary
      subjects; I decided to take economics over chemistry because I found it
      more fascinating, and although my main interests lie in the sciences, I
      liked the idea of having a humanities subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve won over 25 high-school technology quizzes, design events and
      hackathons, and I&#39;m currently the defending national champion of the
      Texas Instruments Science &amp; Technology Quiz.
